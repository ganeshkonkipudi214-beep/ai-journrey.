# AI Journey 🚀

This repository contains my Python learning journey
from Day 1 to Day 5 as part of my AI/ML roadmap.

## What I Learned

- Day 1: Python basics, setup, first program  
- Day 2: Variables, data types, input, conditions  
- Day 3: Loops (for loop, range, reverse loops)  
- Day 4: Nested loops, star patterns, number patterns  
- Day 5: Conditions, grade calculation, pass/fail logic  

## Goal
To become confident in Python and prepare for a software / AI role step by step.

## Status
Learning daily and improving problem-solving logic.
